This file describes the concept of federated wikibase repositories.

This file is currently a STUB, referencing existing documentation on some aspects of federation. More comprehensive documentation of the concept should be added here.

* "Foreign" is used to mean that something refers to and comes from another wikibase repository.
* Foreign EntityIds and mappings are documented in the file docs/foreign-entity-ids.wiki in the wikibase/data-model component.
* Configuration of foreign repositories is done using the ''foreignRepositories'' setting in $wgWBClientSettings, as documented in the file docs/options.wiki.
